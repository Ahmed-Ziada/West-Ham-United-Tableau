# Tableau - West-Ham-United   
Identify future talents. While working with your fellow scouts and Chief Scout Using Tableau to analyze, Visulaize, and report for the insights I got.  

# What Asked from fellow scouts and Chief Scout
1.	As West Ham United need an immediate impact player, the Chief Scout, Oliver Scott, has told you to only select players with at least TWO (2) seasons of experience playing in a first team (Hint: Choose players that meet the requirement when visualizing).
2.	David Moyes, the Head Coach of the club, has told you that he needs TWO (2) good Defenders that can operate on both left and right sides of the field (Hint: Find a player by the position and preferred foot).
3.	On the other hand, the Chairman, David Sullivan Sullivan, is worried about the financial packages that the club needs to prepare for the potential player. Therefore, he wanted a disciplined player with low debt and a less financial lifestyle (Hint: Look at the player's debt while also comparing it with its asset or liability).
4.	Finally, after three hours of meeting with David Moyes, David Sullivan, Oliver Scott, and the other four scouts, you have been asked by Oliver Scott to prepare the Top 10 names that you and your fellow scouts have evaluated (Hint: Clean the Scout 1 to Scout 5 reports in Tableau).
5.	You need to write a full report convincing the management that your potential players have met their requirements by showing all of the information from Question 1 to 4
